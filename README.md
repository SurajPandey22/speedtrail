## 🌟 Overview

**SpeedTrail** is a full-stack flatmate expense tracking web app. It allows a group of flatmates to:

- Import shared expenses from a **CSV file** with intelligent anomaly detection
- Track **who paid what**, and compute **who owes whom**
- Handle complex scenarios: **mid-tenure member changes**, **multi-currency expenses**, **unequal splits**, **settlements**, and **refunds**
- Simplify outstanding debts into the **minimum number of transactions**

> ⚠️ This app is **private** — registration is restricted to `@flat.com` email addresses only.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- Secure login with **NextAuth.js** (credentials provider)
- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt** (salt rounds: 10)
- Session-protected routes — unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- Registration restricted to **`@flat.com` domain only** (both client + server enforced)
- Smart redirect: unregistered users are sent from login → signup with email pre-filled

### 📥 Smart CSV Import (Zero Silent Failures)
- Upload any `.csv` or `.tsv` file of expenses
- Full **anomaly detection pipeline** across 18+ anomaly types (see below)
- Staging review UI — every row shows its detected issues with a suggested fix
- User **approves or rejects** each row individually before anything is written to the database
- Post-commit **import report** showing every row's final status

### 💱 Multi-Currency Support
- All USD expenses are converted to INR at a **user-provided exchange rate** during import
- Preset rates (₹83.5, ₹84, ₹85…) + **custom rate input** supported
- Original amount and currency are preserved in the database for full auditability

### 💸 Flexible Split Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `equal` | Total divided equally among all listed members |
| `unequal` | Each member's exact share specified in rupees |
| `percentage` | Each member's share specified as a percentage |
| `share` | Each member assigned a number of shares (weighted equal split) |

### 📊 Balances & Debt Simplification
- **Net Balances view** (Aisha's requirement): Who owes (+) or is owed (-) overall
- **Exact Breakdown view** (Rohan's requirement): Every single expense with your share
- **Settle Up suggestions**: Greedy algorithm computing the minimum number of payments to clear all debts
- Date-range filter to view balances from a specific date (useful for Sam who joined mid-period)

### 👥 Time-Aware Memberships
- Members have `joined_at` and `left_at` dates on the group
- The import engine **validates split participants against expense date** — Meera (left Mar 31) won't be billed for April expenses
- The balances engine filters by membership window

## 🔍 CSV Anomaly Detection

The import engine (`src/lib/importer.ts`) detects **18 anomaly types** before any data touches the database:

| Anomaly | Detection Logic |
|---------|----------------|
| `DUPLICATE` | Same date + description + payer + amount as another row |
| `MALFORMED_AMOUNT` | Commas in number (e.g. `1,200`) — suggests stripping comma |
| `MALFORMED_DATE` | Unparseable date format |
| `AMBIGUOUS_DATE` | `DD-MM` vs `MM-DD` is ambiguous — asks for confirmation |
| `UNKNOWN_PAYER` | Payer name fails exact match; fuzzy (Levenshtein) suggests closest |
| `PAYER_CASE_MISMATCH` | `priya` vs `Priya` — suggests title-cased version |
| `MISSING_PAYER` | `paid_by` field is blank |
| `MISSING_CURRENCY` | Currency field is blank — suggests group default (INR) |
| `SETTLEMENT_AS_EXPENSE` | Notes mention "settlement" but row is structured as expense |
| `PERCENTAGE_SUM_INVALID` | Percentages don't add up to 100% — blocked, must fix manually |
| `NEGATIVE_AMOUNT` | Negative value treated as a **refund** expense |
| `ZERO_AMOUNT` | Zero-value expense — skipped by default, user must approve |
| `EXTRA_PRECISION` | More than 2 decimal places — suggests rounding |
| `INACTIVE_MEMBER_IN_SPLIT` | A split member has `left_at` before the expense date |
| `UNKNOWN_MEMBER_IN_SPLIT` | A split member is not in the known members list |
| `FOREIGN_CURRENCY` | Non-INR currency — converted using the user-provided rate |
| `CONFLICTING_SPLIT_TYPE` | e.g. `equal` type but `split_details` present — resolves gracefully |
| `NON_EXPENSE_TRANSFER` | Notes indicate a bank transfer / deposit — treated as settlement |

## ⚙ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or higher
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 13 or higher (running locally)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd speedtrail-app
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/speedtrail"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-change-in-production"
```

> ℹ️ If you have multiple PostgreSQL versions, check which port your instance is running on (common: `5432` for v14+, `5433` for v13).

### 3. Initialize the Database

The app auto-runs `schema.sql` on first boot via `initDb()`. To seed the initial members manually, run:

```bash
node add-suraj.js
```

Or connect to your PostgreSQL instance and run `src/lib/db/schema.sql` directly.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 5. Import Expenses

1. Navigate to **Import CSV**
2. Upload `expenses_export.csv` from the project root
3. Set the USD → INR exchange rate (default: ₹83.5)
4. Review the detected anomalies
5. Click **Commit Approved Rows**

## 🧠 Engineering Decisions

### 1. Multi-Currency — User-provided rate at import time
Instead of calling an FX API or maintaining multi-currency ledgers, the user specifies the USD→INR rate when uploading the CSV. This matches the actual bank rate they paid and keeps the debt ledger in a single currency (INR), making settlement trivial.

### 2. Time-Aware Memberships — `joined_at` / `left_at`
Rather than splitting into separate groups when Meera left and Sam joined, a single group with time-bound membership rows is used. The importer validates split participants against the expense date, and the balances view accepts a `fromDate` parameter so Sam can filter to only his period.

### 3. Debt Simplification — Greedy Algorithm `O(N log N)`
Sort creditors and debtors by net balance descending, then repeatedly match the largest debtor with the largest creditor. This guarantees at most `N−1` transactions — practically optimal for ≤10 flatmates, and far simpler than a full graph-flow solution.

### 4. Import Philosophy — Staging, not silent fixes
The entire CSV is parsed into a staging session. No data touches the production tables until the user explicitly clicks **Commit**. Every anomaly is surfaced with a suggested action. This was a hard requirement from Meera.

### 5. Database — PostgreSQL over SQLite
`better-sqlite3` requires `node-gyp` native compilation which fails on Windows without Python + VS Build Tools. Switching to PostgreSQL with the pure-JavaScript `pg` driver eliminated all build issues while giving a more robust, production-grade database (JSONB, strict types, proper date handling for financial data).

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Single group only**: The app is hardcoded to `group_id = 1`. Multi-group support would require routing changes.
- **No real-time updates**: The UI doesn't use WebSockets; refresh the page to see changes made by other users.
- **No email verification**: Signup is validated by domain (`@flat.com`) but no email OTP is sent.
